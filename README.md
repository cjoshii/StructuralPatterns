# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.

### 1. [Adapter](./Adapter)

Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.

### 2. [Bridge](./Bridge)

Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### 3. [Composite](./Composite)

Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### 4. [Decorator](./Decorator)

Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
